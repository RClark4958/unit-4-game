# unit-4-game

This project assigns a numeric value to four crystals, increases the user's total with each click, and awards a win if a randomly generated value is reached exactly.

The game relies on javascript to handle click events, math calculations, and generating new rounds. 

Rick Clark maintains and contributes to this project.
